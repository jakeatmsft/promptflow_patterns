# Notices:
# - Don't replace the '<user-input>' placeholder in this file, the application will prompt you to enter a value when it runs.
# - Manually save the file will create the connection after basic validation.
# - The connection information will be stored in a local database with api_key encrypted for safety.
# - Prompt flow will ONLY use the connection information (incl. keys) when instructed by you, e.g. manage connections, use connections to run flow etc.
# - All the values should be string type, please use "123" instead of 123 or "True" instead of True.
